# NLP-yelp-review

NLP project to classify Yelp Reviews into 1 star or 5 star categories based off the text content in the reviews. Created a pipeline for CountVectorizer, TF-IDF and Naive-Bayes classifier

We will use the Yelp Review Data Set from Kaggle.

I used Pandas for data analysis and Matplotlib/seaborn for data visualization.Finally, I evaluated the results using a confusion matrix and classification report.
